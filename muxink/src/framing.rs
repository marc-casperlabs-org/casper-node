//! Frame encoding/decoding.
//!
//! A frame is a finite unit of bytes to be sent discretely over an underlying networking stream.
//! Usually some sort of framing mechanism needs to be employed to convert from discrete values to
//! continuous bytestreams and back, see the [`FrameEncoder`] and [`FrameDecoder`] traits for
//! details.
//!
//! # Available implementations
//!
//! Currently, the following transcoders and frame decoders are available:
//!
//! * [`length_delimited`]: Transforms byte-like values into self-contained frames with a
//!   length-prefix.
